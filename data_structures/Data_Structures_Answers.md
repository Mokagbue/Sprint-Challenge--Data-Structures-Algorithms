Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
        O(n), all the nodes are traversed, we have to visit every single node 
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
        O(n) *space being memeory usage*
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
        O(n), we are calling on each level once
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
        O(n) too  
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
        O(n log n)
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
        O(2n)
        <!--10 elements:
            10 for sorted
            10 for the heap
            =
            20... hence O(2n) -->
